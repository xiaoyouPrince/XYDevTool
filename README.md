DevTool
============

A simple UI and powerful Mac OS application. It is a collection of tools commonly used in my development work. It is open source and hopes to help people in need. At present, its main functions are as follows

- JSON formatting tool: used to quickly format network JSON data into formatted JSON for easy reading

- JSON to model: read JSON data and generate swift model. It supports a variety of configuration options, especially for complex JSON parsing, which fully liberates both hands

- Appicon generator: supports the generation of IOS / MacOS app icons, one click generation and export to the specified directory

- Network request tool: a convenient network request tool, intended to replace postman and speed up the continuous adjustment of front and rear interfaces. Automatically record historical request records and support export / import.

- ...
